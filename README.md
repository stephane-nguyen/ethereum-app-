# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

> run local blockchain network

```
npx hardhat node
```

> then deploy locally

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

> deploy with goerli

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
